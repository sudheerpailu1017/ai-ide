AI-IDE: The Future of Smarter Coding
AI-IDE is a browser-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that uses Lyzr AI (GPT-4o-mini) to assist developers by automating code generation and execution. Its primary goal is to allow developers to focus on product development while AI-IDE takes care of common coding tasks. With features like Intelligent Autocomplete, Real-Time Code Testing, and Smart Rewrites, AI-IDE helps improve productivity by streamlining the coding process, ensuring developers can spend more time building and improving their projects.

**Key Features**
**AI-Powered Code Generation**
AI-IDE uses Lyzr AI (GPT-4o-mini) to generate, optimize, and enhance code based on natural language inputs. Whether you need to generate algorithms like quicksort or tackle complex logic, the AI helps write optimized, efficient code seamlessly. This feature boosts productivity by automating repetitive coding tasks and providing ready-to-use solutions.

**Browser-Based IDE**
AI-IDE is entirely browser-based, meaning you can access the full power of an IDE without any installation or setup. Code, test, and run applications directly from your web browser on any device, making it convenient for developers to work anytime, anywhere.

**Syntax Highlighting**
To improve code readability and debugging, AI-IDE comes with built-in syntax highlighting. The editor visually distinguishes between keywords, variables, and functions, making it easier for developers to spot errors and understand code structure.

**Intelligent Autocomplete**
AI-IDE’s intelligent autocomplete suggests code as you type, reducing the need for manual code writing. This feature improves coding speed and accuracy by predicting what you’re going to write next. Whether you're completing partial code fragments or writing entire functions, this tool saves time and minimizes errors.

**Real-Time Code Testing**
AI-IDE integrates Pyodide to run Python code directly within the IDE, allowing real-time output and debugging. This feature offers instant feedback as you build your project, enabling continuous testing and troubleshooting throughout the development process.

**Multiline Edits**
AI-IDE supports multiline editing, which allows developers to refactor or rewrite multiple lines of code at once. This functionality enhances workflow by enabling batch editing of related sections, saving time and effort.

**Smart Rewrites**
Even if your typing is inaccurate or incomplete, AI-IDE automatically rewrites and fixes common coding mistakes. This intelligent correction system ensures clean, functional code and lets developers focus on higher-level logic rather than worrying about syntax.
